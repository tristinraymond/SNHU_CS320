How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

First and foremost, I believe functionality and security go hand in hand when it comes to creating software. If the program does not work as intended, then the user will never be able to rely on it, and if it is not secure, then the user cannot trust it. For me, ensuring functionality starts with testing. I would begin with smaller unit tests to make sure that individual parts of the program are doing exactly what they should. From there, I'd move to bigger tests, like integration or system tests, to make sure everything works together properly. I also think code reviews play a huge role here, as having another set of eyes often brings up problems I may not have noticed.

Security, on the other hand, is something I would build into the process from the start. This means thinking about things like validating user inputs, making sure sensitive data is handled carefully, and staying on top of updates or patches. I would argue that security is not just an afterthought but something that should be included in the design and testing phases. In my own experience with projects, I’ve found that even small steps like sanitizing inputs or using secure libraries can prevent major issues later.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

When it comes to understanding user needs, I usually like to start by looking at the big picture of what the user is asking for. Sometimes it helps me to think about what the end product could look like and then work backwards to figure out the smaller steps. In that way, I almost create a kind of branching diagram in my head, where the main goal is at the top and smaller requirements split off into different paths.

From there, I try to translate those user needs into features or requirements. For example, if the user wants something to be “easy to use,” I think about what that really means in terms of design—maybe fewer clicks, a simpler layout, or more clear instructions. I think the key is not only to capture the user’s wants but also to check in with them during the process to make sure my interpretation matches their actual expectations. In past projects, even when the requirements were made-up scenarios in class, I found that sketching out user stories or sample use cases helped me stay focused on what the user actually needed rather than what I thought they wanted.


How do I approach designing software?

I would argue that software design is one of the most important steps in development because it sets the stage for everything else. For me, the design process begins with taking a step back and fully understanding the problem. Once I feel like I have a good grasp on what needs to be solved, I start to picture what the system as a whole should look like. This might mean sketching out diagrams, drawing flowcharts, or even just writing notes about how different parts of the program should interact.

After that, I like to break things down into smaller pieces, almost like moving from the general shape of a tree to its branches and then to the leaves. For example, I’ll start with the architecture, then move into the details like classes, data structures, or user interface elements. At each step, I think about not only how it will work but also how it can scale or adapt if the requirements change later. In my own projects, I usually find that designing in iterations works best—I make an initial design, try it out, get feedback, and then refine it. This way, I don’t get stuck on a design that looked good at first but doesn’t actually meet the needs in practice.
